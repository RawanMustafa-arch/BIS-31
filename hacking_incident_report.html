    <h1>The Equifax Data Breach & How to Secure Your Website</h1>
    <p><strong>Prepared by:</strong> Rawan<br><strong>Date:</strong> May 2025</p>

    <h2>What Happened at Equifax?</h2>
    <p>In 2017, Equifax, one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the United States, suffered a massive cyberattack. Hackers stole sensitive information of over 147 million people, including names, Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses, and in some cases, driver’s license numbers.</p>

    <h2>How the Hack Occurred</h2>
    <p>The attackers exploited a known vulnerability in Apache Struts, a popular open-source web framework. Although a patch had been released, Equifax failed to apply it in time. This allowed attackers to gain unauthorized access and remain inside the system undetected for over two months.</p>

    <h2>Impact of the Breach</h2>
    <p>This breach affected more than half of the U.S. adult population. It triggered widespread public outrage and led to Equifax paying up to $700 million in settlements, fines, and remediation costs. The company’s reputation suffered major damage.</p>

    <h2>Security Mistakes Made</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Failure to patch a known vulnerability.</li>
        <li>Lack of adequate system monitoring and alerts.</li>
        <li>Weak internal cybersecurity practices and communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Always apply security patches immediately.</li>
        <li>Monitor systems continuously and set up real-time alerts.</li>
        <li>Conduct employee training on cybersecurity awareness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Secure a Website</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.</li>
        <li>Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent SQL injection.</li>
        <li>Require strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Server and Code Protection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Back up your data regularly and test the recovery process.</li>
        <li>Restrict access to admin panels and use secure coding practices.</li>
        <li>Install a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block common attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples of Security Tools</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloudflare / Sucuri:</strong> WAF and DDoS protection.</li>
        <li><strong>OWASP:</strong> Guides for secure coding and vulnerability testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Fail2Ban, BitNinja:</strong> Server protection against brute-force attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Website security is essential in today’s digital age. The Equifax breach shows how a single oversight can lead to massive consequences. To avoid such disasters, stay updated, monitor your systems, and prioritize cybersecurity in every part of your development process.</p>
